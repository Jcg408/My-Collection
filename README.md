My-Collection
README Overview - React/Redux/Rails Final Project/Flatiron School/ J. Gladstone - June 2019

Personal App for documenting my collection of Russian Lacquer Art. 

The application uses React as a frontend to render view. Redux is used as intermediary to hold state object. Rails is used as backend. 

I have added seed data for testing and used Bootstrap for basic container with personal css for styling.

To install this app, follow these steps:

1. Fork and clone the repository  
2. open terminal in /railsApi and run bundle install, rake db:migrate, rake db:seed, run rails server -p 3001(port 3001).
3. open a second terminal in / client and run npm i,  run npm start (port 3000) which should launch the browser automatically to view the site.
